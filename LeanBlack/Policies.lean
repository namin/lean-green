  Policy library + soundness statements.

  A `BlackPolicy : Val → Val → Bool` decides whether to admit a
  meta-env mutation. Soundness is parameterized over an architectural
  floor `P : Val → Val → Prop` — the property the policy claims to
  preserve when admitting (old, new) transitions. The canonical
  instance is `CE` (conservative extension): every behavior the old
  base-apply gave is preserved by the new one, modulo the value
  bisimulation `ValVis` defined in `Bisim.lean`.

  Stating `CE` against `ValVis` rather than `=` is the principled
  formulation for languages with closures-as-values: Kumar 2016 §3.2
  argues for it directly, since closure equality across distinct
  evaluations doesn't hold (different captured envs even when bodies
  are syntactically equal).

  ## What's proved here vs. what's left

  - Helper lemmas: `applyDirect_num_returns_none`,
    `callAsBaseApply_builtin_num_none`, `valToList_listToVal`,
    `applyPrim_numq_nonnum` — fully proved.
  - `rejectAll.SoundForCE` — trivially proved.
  - `numGuardPolicy.Sound NumGuardShape` — proved (structural).
  - `multnExactPolicy.Sound MultnExactShape` — proved (structural).
  - `multnExact_CE_num_case_vacuous` — proved (numerical operators
    are CE-vacuous).
  - `multnExact_soundForCE_first_install` — fully proved (conditional
    on the install-protocol facts in `InstallFacts`, the runtime
    invariants in `RuntimeWF`, and the new `PolicyTableRespectsBisim`/
    `PolicyRespectsBisim s.policy` hypotheses introduced when the
    `.set` case of `frame.eval` was closed).
  - `multnExact_CE_nonnum_case` — proved up to a single localized
    `sorry` for the `WFCtx.heap_len_eq` field. The proof technique
    sets up an asymmetric `(s, s_alloc)` framing that doesn't satisfy
    the new `heap_len_eq` invariant; resolution path (single-side
    `applyDirect` prefix-extension lemma) documented in `DUMP3.md`.
  - `multn_closure_body_unfolds` — fully proved (the deterministic
    eval-trace lemma through the closure body).

/-! ## Calling a Val as base-apply -/

/-- Call a `Val` as if it were the meta-env's `base-apply`. The
    builtin dispatcher takes `(op, operands)` directly; a closure
    replacement takes `(op, listOf operands)`. -/
def callAsBaseApply (fuel : Nat) (ptable : PolicyTable) (baseApply : Val)
    (op : Val) (operands : List Val) (metaEnv : Env) (s : RunState)
    : Option (Val × RunState) :=
  match baseApply with
  | .builtinBaseApply => applyDirect fuel ptable op operands metaEnv s
  | _                 => applyDirect fuel ptable baseApply
                                     [op, listToVal operands] metaEnv s

/-- **Conservative extension** between two candidate base-apply
    values, formulated against the value-bisimulation `ValVis`.
    `new` conservatively extends `old` if every (op, operands)
    where `old` succeeds, `new` also succeeds with a `ValVis`-related
    result *and* the post-states are well-formed and agree.

    The full conclusion bundles:
    - `ValVis r r' s'.heap s''.heap` — results bisim-related.
    - `s'.policy = s''.policy` — both post-states agree on policy.
      A reflective replacement that hijacked the policy would
      violate this (and so violate CE).
    - `HeapValid s''.heap` — the new post-state heap is well-
      formed, so further calls remain safe.
    - `s.heap.length ≤ s''.heap.length` — the new call doesn't
      shrink the heap. (`HeapValid` + monotonicity together mean
      the new heap is a real extension of the initial state.)

    The fuel may differ on the two sides — `new` typically needs
    more fuel than `old` because the closure body adds eval steps. -/
def CE (old new : Val) : Prop :=
  ∀ fuel ptable op operands metaEnv s r s',
    callAsBaseApply fuel ptable old op operands metaEnv s = some (r, s') →
    ∃ fuel' s'' r',
      callAsBaseApply fuel' ptable new op operands metaEnv s = some (r', s'') ∧
      ValVis r r' s'.heap s''.heap ∧
      s'.policy = s''.policy ∧
      HeapValid s''.heap ∧
      s.heap.length ≤ s''.heap.length

abbrev BlackPolicy.SoundForCE (p : BlackPolicy) : Prop := p.Sound CE

/-- **Behavioral CE** — the bisimulation conclusion uses `ValVis_weak`
    instead of `ValVis`. Equivalent to `CE` for first-order results
    (numbers, booleans, primitives), but strictly weaker for closure-
    typed results: `CE_weak` allows result closures to have cenvs that
    differ structurally as long as cell lookups give bisim values,
    whereas `CE` demands Lean-equal cenvs.

    `CE_weak` is the right behavioral statement for higher-order
    base-apply replacements: when `new`'s closure body alloc's its
    arg cells before delegating to `old`, the heap-shift introduces a
    uniform offset in the post-region indices. `ValVis` is broken by
    that offset on closure-typed results; `ValVis_weak` is preserved.

    See `FINDING_SORRY.md` for the full architectural argument.
    `CE` ⟹ `CE_weak` (via `ValVis_to_weak`); the strong version
    remains the principled goal where it's provable. -/

      callAsBaseApply fuel' ptable new op operands metaEnv s = some (r', s'') ∧
      ValVis_weak r r' s'.heap s''.heap ∧
      s'.policy = s''.policy ∧

/-! ### `multnExactPolicy` — strict multn shape + install-protocol check

    Admits exactly the multn pattern:
    `(λ (op args) (if (num? op) <then> (orig op args)))`,
    and verifies the install-protocol facts at runtime against the
    live mutation context:

    - `ctx.target = "base-apply"` (only `base-apply` mutations are
      admitted; mutating `"+"` etc. is refused even if shape matches).
    - the closure's captured `orig` cell holds *the current
      `oldVal`* — i.e., whatever value is at `base-apply` at install
      time. For first install: `.builtinBaseApply`. For multi-install:
      the previous multn closure. The check uses `Val.beq` (defined
      mutually in `Black.lean`); the lemma `val_beq_eq` lifts it to
      a propositional equality the bridge lemma uses.
    - the closure's captured `num?` cell holds `.prim "num?"`
      (so the body's cond evaluation can resolve).

    These checks correspond exactly to `InstallFacts oldVal new
    ctx.heap`; the bridge lemma `multnExactPolicy_implies_InstallFacts`
    below witnesses this for any `oldVal`. -/

/-- The closure's captured env binds `"num?"` to the `.prim "num?"`

    a `multnExactPolicy`-shaped modification: the new closure's

    `"num?"` to `.prim "num?"`. Parameterized by `oldVal` to

/-! ## multn closure-body trace lemma

    With `fuel ≥ 2`, `callAsBaseApply` on the multn closure unfolds
    in `fuel + 4` steps to `applyDirect fuel op operands` at the
    alloc'd state.

    The proof steps through `applyDirect`'s closure case (length
    check + foldl alloc + eval body), then `eval` of the `.ifte`
    cond and else branches. Each step is a definitional reduction;
    `simp only [...]` keyed on the four heap+env lookup facts
    (`hl_numq` / `hl_op` / `hl_args` / `hl_orig` and their `hp_*`
    heap counterparts) plus the standard reduction lemmas
    (`applyPrim_numq_nonnum`, `valToList_listToVal`) discharges
    each block. -/

/-- **Non-numerical-operator half** — the substantive trace through
    the closure body. Closure body's else-branch delegates to
    `orig` (`= .builtinBaseApply` by `OrigBoundIn`); the resulting
    inner `applyDirect (.builtinBaseApply) [op, listToVal operands]`
    dispatches to `applyDirect op operands`, which by `frame`
    (defined in `Bisim.lean`) gives a `ValVis`-related result.

    Required hypotheses surfaced during proof design:
    - `OrigBoundIn` — closure cenv binds `"orig"` to a heap cell
      holding `.builtinBaseApply`.
    - `NumQBoundIn` — closure cenv binds `"num?"` to `.prim "num?"`,
      so the body's cond evaluation can resolve.
    - `HeapValid s.heap` — for using `EnvVis_aux_extends` through the
      framing chain.
    - `EnvValid metaEnv s.heap` — for the metaEnv preservation step.

    The runner's install protocol guarantees all four when admitting
    a multn modification from the standard initial state. -/
